# Variational-quantum-state-discriminator

Authored by **Vladyslav Los** (*vladyslav.los@rwth-aachen.de*, GitHub: *@vlalos*)

In this notebook we implement a quantum neural network and train it to discriminate between two sets of 2-qubit quantum states - Quantum State Discriminator (QSD). 

The implementation is based on the work done by <a href="https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s42484-020-00025-7" target="_blank">Chen et al. (2021)</a> and <a href="https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013063" target="_blank">Patterson et al. (2021)</a>.
